description: Learn how to fork a repository, work locally with npm, and open your first pull request.

Contributing to open source can feel intimidating at first. This walkthrough shows every step you need to take to get a project running locally, make a change, and share it back with the community.

## 1. Gather the prerequisites

Before you start, install these tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning repositories and tracking your work.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer is recommended) which includes `npm`, the package manager used for JavaScript projects.
- A code editor you are comfortable with, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

After installing Node.js you can verify the tools are available:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

Seeing version numbers means everything is installed correctly.

## 2. Fork the project on GitHub

1. Open the project repository in your browser.
2. Select **Fork** in the top-right corner and choose your personal GitHub account.
3. Wait for GitHub to finish copying the project into your account.

You now have your own copy where you can experiment safely.

## 3. Clone your fork and connect the original project

In your terminal:

```bash
# Replace <your-username> with your GitHub handle
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/arc-docs.git
cd arc-docs
```

Next, point your local copy back to the original repository (often called the *upstream* remote):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArcInstitute/arc-docs.git
git remote -v
```

The final command should list both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the main project).

## 4. Install dependencies with npm

From inside the project folder, install everything the docs site needs:

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads packages into a local `node_modules` directory.

If the project stores its docs in a subdirectory (for example, this repository keeps its site in `2025/`), change into that folder and install packages there as well:

```bash
cd 2025
npm install
```

> ðŸ’¡ Some projects prefer `pnpm` or `yarn`. Always check the repository README or package scripts to confirm which tool to use.

## 5. Create a feature branch

Keep your changes organized by working on a dedicated branch:

```bash
# from the repository root
git checkout -b docs/beginner-contributing-guide
```

Use a short, descriptive name that matches the task you are completing.

## 6. Run the docs locally

Most documentation sites built with Next.js expose a development server script. In this project you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The command starts a local server (commonly at `http://localhost:3000`) and automatically reloads when you save files. Explore the site to find the page you want to edit or add.

## 7. Make your changes

Now you are ready to update content:

1. Create or edit `.mdx` files in `2025/content/docs/`.
2. Use Markdown headings (`##`) to structure the page and keep paragraphs short.
3. Save the file and refresh the browser tab to confirm the docs render correctly.

For broader changes, remember to update navigation files like `meta.json` so your new page appears in the sidebar.

## 8. Preview and test

Before committing, make sure automated checks pass. Documentation-only updates usually need linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal if any issues appear. Some projects also include formatting or unit test commandsâ€”run whatever the repository documents in its contributing guide.

## 9. Commit your work

Stage the files you changed and create a commit message that explains *why* you made the update:

```bash
git status
# review the list of files

git add 2025/content/docs/beginner-contributing.mdx 2025/content/docs/meta.json

git commit -m "docs: add beginner contribution guide"
```

Good commit messages use the imperative voice ("add", "fix", "update") and keep the first line under 72 characters.

## 10. Push the branch to your fork

Send your branch to GitHub so you can open a pull request:

```bash
git push -u origin docs/beginner-contributing-guide
```

The `-u` flag tells Git to remember the branch, making future pushes simpler.

## 11. Open a pull request

1. Visit your fork on GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request** next to your branch.
3. Fill in the pull request template, summarize your changes, and include screenshots if the docs site changed visually.
4. Submit the pull request for review.

## 12. Keep your branch up to date

While you wait for feedback, the main project may change. Keep your work current by syncing the latest commits:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout docs/beginner-contributing-guide
git merge main
```

Resolve any merge conflicts, rerun tests, and push again.

## 13. Respond to review feedback

Maintainers may request edits before merging. Address each comment, commit the updates, and push to the same branch. The pull request automatically refreshes.

## 14. Celebrate and continue contributing

Once your pull request is merged, GitHub marks the branch as merged and the documentation site will include your changes. You can delete the branch locally and on GitHub:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d docs/beginner-contributing-guide
git push origin --delete docs/beginner-contributing-guide
```

Keep your fork by running `git pull upstream main` occasionally so you are ready for your next contribution.

### Quick reference checklist

- [ ] Fork the repository and clone your fork.
- [ ] Add the upstream remote.
- [ ] Install dependencies with the documented package manager.
- [ ] Create a branch and run the docs locally.
- [ ] Make, test, and commit your changes.
- [ ] Push to your fork and open a pull request.
- [ ] Sync with upstream if new commits land.

You're now set to grow from your first change to regular contributions. Happy documenting!
