### 🐧 Master the Terminal

Linux can seem intimidating at first, but with the right resources, anyone can become a command-line ninja. Here are some tips to make your journey smoother:

- **Start Small**: Begin with basic commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and `cp`. They are the bread and butter of terminal navigation.  
- **Use Man Pages**: Type `man <command>` to get the official documentation. It’s your in-terminal mentor.  
- **Learn by Doing**: The more you experiment with commands, the faster you’ll retain them. Break things (safely) and fix them.  
- **Shortcuts Save Time**: Master tab completion, command history (`Ctrl+R`), and pipes (`|`) to boost efficiency.  
- **Cheat Sheets Are Friends**: Keep a handy cheat sheet open while practicing. You’ll reference it less and less over time.
