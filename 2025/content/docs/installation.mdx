<Callout type="warn" title="Windows users: Install WSL first">
If you're on Windows, you'll need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) before proceeding. See the WSL installation section below.
</Callout>

## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

<Callout type="info" title="MacOS users can skip this section">
MacOS is UNIX-based, so you can jump straight to installing [package managers](#install-package-managers).
</Callout>

Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's WSL?">
Introduced by Microsoft in 2016, WSL allows people to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows.

Before WSL, people had to:
- Use a virtual machine, slow.
- Dual boot on the same machine, tedious and risks bricking the machine.
- Replace their main OS with Linux altogether, scary but the best option.

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why use WSL instead of switching to Linux?">
WSL allows you to:
- have the best of both worlds by running Linux and Windows simultaneously.
- Use Linux tools and commands directly from Windows without switching operating systems.
- Run various development environments smoothly without leaving your Windows OS.

You can still access the Windows filesystem from Linux and vice versa and avoid the hassle of dual booting.

[Why Dual booting on the same drive is not worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/risks-dual-booting-windows-linux-operating-systems/).
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="But im not comfortable working from the shell">
    Although it is better working from the shell. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.
  </Accordion>

  <div className="step">
  Enable [essential Windows features](https://winaero.com/bash-ubuntu-windows-10-fall-creators-update/) to enable WSL.
    
    <kbd> Win+R</kbd> to open Run dialog, then:

    ```sh title="Run"
    optionalfeatures # opens 'Windows Features' Dialog

Turn on the following features if not already enabled.

Restart your machine for these changes to take effect.

After restart, launch 'Microsoft Store', and search 'Linux'.

    Create your UNIX account.

    Keep your password short and simple for now. You'll need to type it often to install packages.
    <Callout type="warn" title="Don't forget your UNIX username & password">
    You'll be locked out and will have to re-install WSL.

      ```
      Enter new UNIX username: user
      New password:

      passwd: password updated successfully

      To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".

## Install Package Managers

<div className="steps">
<div className="step">

Clean existing system files. You can always re-install these later.

    ```sh title="Terminal"
    sudo rm -rf "$(which npm node pnpm)" "$(where npm node pnpm)"
    ```


### [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

```sh title="Terminal"
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why we use pnpm">
We use **pnpm** instead of **npm** because it is faster, more efficient with disk space, and enforces stricter dependency management.  
Unlike npm or yarn, pnpm uses a content-addressable store and hard links, which means packages are downloaded once and reused across all projects ‚Äî saving both time and storage.  
It also prevents phantom dependencies by ensuring that only explicitly listed packages are accessible, leading to more reliable builds.  

üëâ Want to dive deeper? Check out the [official pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation).
</Callout>


Re-open the terminal once installation is complete.

Set [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version.

```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm env use --global 22.17.1  # latest LTS at time of writing
```
<Callout type="warn" title="Use the latest Node.js LTS">
We recommend using the latest **LTS** version of Node.js.  
Check [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.9.0) for the latest version before installing.
</Callout>

## Configure [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)


[Create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) if you don't already have one.

<Tabs items={['Ubuntu(WSL)','MacOS']}>
<Tab value="Ubuntu(WSL)">
```sh title="Terminal"
  # Install GitHub CLI (gh) on Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install gh -y
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="MacOS">
  ```sh title="Terminal"
  # Install GitHub CLI (gh) on MacOS
  brew install gh
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


```sh title="Terminal"
  # Login with your GitHub account.
  gh auth login
```
