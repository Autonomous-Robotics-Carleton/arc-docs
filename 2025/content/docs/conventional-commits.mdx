We follow the [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for
commit messages.

### General Guideline

- Each commit should be a single logical change. Don't make several logical changes in one commit. For example, if a patch fixes a bug and optimizes the performance of a feature, split it into two separate commits.
- Each commit should be able to stand on its own, and each commit should build on the previous one. This way, if a commit introduces a bug, it should be easy to identify and revert.
- Each commit should be deployable and not break the build, tests, or functionality.
- If you're not sure if a commit should be split, it's better to split it if each commit is deployable and doesn't break the build, tests, or functionality.
- If you fixed changes in a past commit, use `git commit --amend` to add changes to the previous commit rather than creating a new one; thus keeping the commit history clean and concise.
  - Only exception to this is if the commit already existed on the `main` branch, in which case a fixup commit should be made rather than an amend. If that commit is amended and force pushed to main, it will diverge the git history for the entire team.
- If you ever amend, reorder, or rebase, your local branch will become divergent from the remote for the amended commit(s), so GitHub won't let you push. Simply force push to overwrite your old branch: `git push --force-with-lease`.

The slight learning curve of writing conventional commits is well worth the effort. It allows us unlock some pretty powerful DevOps which saves the entire team a lot of time in the long run.


#### Types

| Label   | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fix`   | A bug fix in the project (e.g., fixing broken links or typos in the docs) |
| `feat`  | New feature(s) being added to the project (e.g., adding a new search feature to the docs site) |
| `docs`  | A new addition or update to the docs site and/or documentation (e.g., adding a new page explaining a component or updating the API reference) |
| `test`  | New tests being added to the project (e.g., Playwright tests to verify the docs site renders correctly on mobile) |
| `chore` | Tasks that donâ€™t modify business logic code and help maintain the project (e.g., reorganizing docs folders, updating docs dependencies, renaming files in the docs site) |
| `style` | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code and improve readability (e.g., formatting Markdown files, fixing indentation, or adding comments in docs code snippets) |
| `refactor` | A change that improves the readability of code itself without modifying behavior (e.g., cleaning up docs site components, creating helper functions for repeated content) |
| `perf`   | A code change that improves performance (e.g., optimizing the docs site build time or loading speed) |
| `build`  | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., upgrading the docs site framework or dependencies) |
| `ci`     | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (e.g., adding a script to automatically build or deploy the docs site) |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit (e.g., undoing a docs update that broke the site) |
