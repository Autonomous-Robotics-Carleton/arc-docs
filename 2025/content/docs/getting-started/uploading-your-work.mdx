# Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) are the heart of collaboration on GitHub and GitLab. They let you propose changes, get feedback, and merge your work into the main codebase. 

<Callout>“Hey, I made some changes, good to go for the main page?” </Callout>

## Why Pull Requests Matter

- **Collaboration:** Teams can review, discuss, and improve code before it merges.  
- **Transparency:** Everyone can see what changed and why.  
- **Learning/Debugging:** PR discussions often include suggestions, alternatives, and best practices.  
- **History/Logging:** PRs keep a clean, reviewable record of changes over time.

## Typical Pull Request Flow


  ### Step 1. Fork or clone the repo:
    Start by making your own copy of the repository. This keeps your changes separate until you’re ready to propose them.
  
  ### Step 2. Create a new branch:
    Branches are like safe workspaces. Use a descriptive name like ```bash fix/login-bug``` or ```bashfeature/add-navbar</```
  
  ### Step 3. Make your changes:
    Add commits with clear messages. Each commit should tell a small, logical story.
  
  ### Step 4. Push your branch:
    Send your branch up to GitHub or GitLab. Now it lives online instead of just on your computer.
  
  ### Step 5. Open a pull request:
    On the platform, click "New Pull Request" and select your branch. Describe what you changed and why.
  
  ### Step 6. Get feedback:
    Teammates or maintainers will review, comment, and maybe request changes. This is normal and part of the process.
  
  ### Step 7. Merge:
    Once approved, the PR can be merged into the main branch. Congratulations — your contribution is now official!
