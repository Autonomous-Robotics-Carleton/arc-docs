  Just in case you forgot: Rebasing onto `main` before continuing work is the
  secret to happiness.
</Callout>

Always simple rebase your branch onto main before creating a pull request. This ensures that your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes in the main branch. Branch and PR rules are set up for the repo just in case as a guardrail.

Do your best to close a single issue per pull request, and always use the **same PR title as the issue name**. This makes debugging easier later.

<Callout>
PRs that close multiple issues are generally only done by the core team in times of emergency.
</Callout>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What if this issue blocks the next issue I want to work on?">
Simply create a new branch for that issue from the branch for your current pull request and continue working on the next issue on that branch.

This technique is called [branch stacking](https://medium.com/@lneves12/git-how-to-stack-multiple-git-branches-and-rebase-them-like-a-pro-91c0cdf67ef). With the power of `git rebase`, you can continually apply PR feedback for the first branch while making progress for the next task on the second branch.

Once again, [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) makes this quick and easy to do cleanly.

Be mindful about what you're trying to contribute and the type of contribution.
- Double-check [Branching Conventions](/docs/conventional-branch)and [Commit Conventions](/docs/conventional-commits) before making a PR.
- Use the appropriate template that matches with your branch type.
- Ensure your PR scope and subject align with your commit(s).
- If your code isn’t fully ready to be merged, create a draft PR instead.
- Link PR branches with the according issue (if applicable).
- Ensure PR description is solution-specific (describe only the solution since the issue describes the problem at hand already).

If you're getting tired of storing work in progress by stashing changes or amending commits and then switching branches, it's a great sign to look into using [Git Worktrees](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Use-this-git-worktree-add-example-and-never-switch-branches-again).
