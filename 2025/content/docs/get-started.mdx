## Something needs fixing? Want to add a new feature?

Creating an issue documents changes to incorporate and lets everyone know what you're working on.


<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do i create an issue?">
 A GitHub issue is essentially a task card that denotes **what** is being worked on, and by **whom**.

Issues also act as a discussion thread used to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements. Itâ€™s a way to collaborate with the community to solve problems and add enhancements.

You can create and submit issues [here](https://github.com/Autonomous-Robotics-Carleton/arc-docs/issues).

[Here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/147722#discussioncomment-11641354)'s a guide on writing github issues.

Maintainers use issues to track work. Starting without one can result in duplicate or rejected pull requests.

## Why Use a TUI?

Using a [terminal user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) like [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is highly encouraged to manage your commits, branches, staging areas, stashes, and much more.

Itâ€™s also significantly easier to resolve merge conflicts, cherry-pick commits between branches, squash them, amend a few commits back, checkout a specific commit, or stage in hunks.

With LazyGit, you unlock the full power of Git **without having to memorize every command** â€” just navigate with simple keyboard shortcuts.



## Install [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

![Image](/images/lazygit.png)

<Tabs items={['Ubuntu(WSL)','MacOS']}>
<Tab value="Ubuntu(WSL)">
```sh title="Terminal"
  # Install LazyGit on Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lazygit-team/release -y
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install lazygit -y
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="MacOS">
  ```sh title="Terminal"
    # Install LazyGit on MacOS
    brew install lazygit
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's LazyGit?">
LazyGit is a simple **terminal UI for Git** that makes version control much easier to use.  

Instead of typing long Git commands, LazyGit gives you an **interactive, text-based interface** where you can:  
- Stage and commit files with a few keystrokes  
- Switch and manage branches quickly  
- Resolve merge conflicts in a clear way  
- View logs and diffs without leaving your terminal  

Itâ€™s not a replacement for Git â€” itâ€™s a **friendlier layer on top of Git** that saves you time and keystrokes, especially if youâ€™re new to Git or want a faster workflow.

## Learn the Fork and Pull Model

The [Fork and Pull Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) is used to merge external contributions into the project.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's a fork?">
    Forking is creating a personal copy of a repository under your own GitHub account. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project until youâ€™re ready to submit them.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Our codebase is constantly changing and evolving. Keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository with `gh repo sync Autonomous-Robotics-Carleton/arc-docs`.



## Pick an Issue

Comment on an issue on the project board that you're interested in to be assigned, or create one for yourself.

Alternatively, you can also look at the open issues and see if there's anything that you can help with which interests you.

Make sure to let us know that you're interested in working on an issue by commenting on it.

## Create a Branch
Branch from `main` with the following name format:

`yourname/<issue-type>/<issue-number>-<issue-name-kebab-cased>`.

Your branch must be named the same as the issue, without the scopes.

For example, the branch for issue #1 titled 'feat(portal): add login page' would be:

`johndoe/feat/1-add-login-page`.

Please See the [Conventional Branch](/docs/conventional-branch) to learn more.


Commit Changes with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec

Please See the [Conventional Commits](/docs/conventional-commits) to learn more.

### ðŸŽ‰ Great work! Now that your commits follow the proper convention, youâ€™re ready to open a Pull Request.  

Please see the [Pull Request Guidelines](/docs/pull-request) to learn how to submit your changes.
