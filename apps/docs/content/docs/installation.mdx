<Callout type="warn" title="Windows users: Install WSL first">
If you're on Windows, you'll need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) before proceeding. See the WSL installation section below.
</Callout>

## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

<Callout type="info" title="MacOS users can skip this section">
MacOS is UNIX-based, so you can jump straight to installing [package managers](#install-package-managers).
</Callout>

Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's WSL?">
Introduced by Microsoft in 2016, WSL allows people to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows.

Before WSL, people had to:
- Use a virtual machine, slow.
- Dual boot on the same machine, tedious and risks bricking the machine.
- Replace their main OS with Linux altogether, scary but the best option.

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why use WSL instead of switching to Linux?">
WSL allows you to:
- have the best of both worlds by running Linux and Windows simultaneously.
- Use Linux tools and commands directly from Windows without switching operating systems.
- Run various development environments smoothly without leaving your Windows OS.

You can still access the Windows filesystem from Linux and vice versa and avoid the hassle of dual booting.

[Why Dual booting on the same drive is not worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/risks-dual-booting-windows-linux-operating-systems/).
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="But im not comfortable working from the shell">
    Although it is better working from the shell. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Enable Windows Features
  Enable [essential Windows features](https://winaero.com/bash-ubuntu-windows-10-fall-creators-update/) to enable WSL.
    
    <kbd> Win+R</kbd> to open Run dialog, then:

    ```sh title="Run"
    optionalfeatures # opens 'Windows Features' Dialog
    ```

Turn on the following features if not already enabled.

![Image](/images/windowsfeatures.png)

Restart your machine for these changes to take effect.

After restart, launch 'Microsoft Store', and search 'Linux'.

![Image](/images/storedistro.png)

Choose a [distro](https://github.com/sirredbeard/awesome-wsl) to install. We recommend [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl) (non-LTS).

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Create Your UNIX Account

    Keep your password short and simple for now. You'll need to type it often to install packages.
    <Callout type="warn" title="Don't forget your UNIX username & password">
    You'll be locked out and will have to re-install WSL.
    </Callout>

      ```
      Enter new UNIX username: user
      New password:
      Retype new password:
      passwd: password updated successfully
      Installation successful!
      To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
      See "man sudo_root" for details.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install Package Managers

<Steps>
<Step>
### Clean and Install pnpm

Clean existing system files. You can always re-install these later.

    ```sh title="Terminal"
    sudo rm -rf "$(which npm node pnpm)" "$(where npm node pnpm)"
    ```


### [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

```sh title="Terminal"
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why we use pnpm">
We use **pnpm** instead of **npm** because it is faster, more efficient with disk space, and enforces stricter dependency management.  
Unlike npm or yarn, pnpm uses a content-addressable store and hard links, which means packages are downloaded once and reused across all projects — saving both time and storage.  
It also prevents phantom dependencies by ensuring that only explicitly listed packages are accessible, leading to more reliable builds.  

👉 Want to dive deeper? Check out the [official pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation).
</Callout>


Re-open the terminal once installation is complete.

Set [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version.

```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm env use --global 22.17.1  # latest LTS at time of writing
```
<Callout type="warn" title="Use the latest Node.js LTS">
We recommend using the latest **LTS** version of Node.js.  
Check [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.9.0) for the latest version before installing.
</Callout>


</Step>

<Step>
### Configure GitHub CLI


[Create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) if you don't already have one.

<Tabs items={['Ubuntu(WSL)','MacOS']}>
<Tab value="Ubuntu(WSL)">
```sh title="Terminal"
  # Install GitHub CLI (gh) on Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install gh -y
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="MacOS">
  ```sh title="Terminal"
  # Install GitHub CLI (gh) on MacOS
  brew install gh
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


```sh title="Terminal"
  # Login with your GitHub account.
  gh auth login
```

![Image](/images/ghauth.png)

Navigate to the github link shown and paste in the code as usual.

![Image](/images/ghotp.png)


Provide the following answers if prompted.
```
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> Yes

# Your one-time code will be different.
! First copy your one-time code: 95i2-DAE6
Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```


Return to the terminal when you see the `Congratulations, you're all set!` screen.
![Image](/images/githubconfirm.png)

You should see the following:
```
✔ Authentication complete.
- gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
✔ Configured git protocol
✔ Logged in as yourgithubusername
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Your Git Identity (Required)

Git needs your name and email to attach to every commit you make. Without this, you'll see errors like `"Author identity unknown"` or `"Please tell me who you are"` when you try to commit—especially if you're using [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

Run these commands to set your identity globally:

```sh title="Terminal"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Verify it worked:

```sh title="Terminal"
git config --global --get user.name
git config --global --get user.email
```

<Callout type="info" title="Privacy tip">
If you'd rather not expose your real email, you can use GitHub's private "noreply" email address. Find it in your [GitHub email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) under "Keep my email addresses private".
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Install lazygit

[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a terminal UI for git that makes commits, branches, and rebases much easier.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Ubuntu/Debian', 'Fedora/RHEL', 'Arch', 'Windows']}>
<Tab value="macOS">
```sh title="Terminal"
brew install lazygit
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Ubuntu/Debian">
```sh title="Terminal"
sudo apt install lazygit
```
For the latest version, grab a binary from [lazygit releases](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases).
</Tab>
<Tab value="Fedora/RHEL">
```sh title="Terminal"
sudo dnf copr enable atim/lazygit -y && sudo dnf install lazygit
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Arch">
```sh title="Terminal"
sudo pacman -S lazygit
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Windows">
```sh title="PowerShell"
scoop install lazygit
# or
choco install lazygit
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

If your distro isn't listed, check the [official releases page](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases).
</Step>

<Step>
### GitHub SSH Setup (Recommended for Pushing)

If you plan to push code using `git push` or lazygit (not just `gh` CLI), setting up SSH keys prevents `Permission denied (publickey)` errors.

<Callout type="info" title="Already using gh auth?">
`gh auth login` handles authentication for the GitHub CLI, but SSH keys are still needed when pushing via regular git commands or lazygit with an SSH remote.
</Callout>

**1. Generate an SSH key:**

```sh title="Terminal"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Press Enter to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`). You can set a passphrase or leave it empty.

<Callout type="warn" title="Keep the default filename">
Don't rename the key file unless you know how to configure SSH to find it. Stick with `id_ed25519`.
</Callout>

**2. Start the SSH agent and add your key:**

```sh title="Terminal"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**3. Copy your public key:**

```sh title="Terminal"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the entire output.

**4. Add the key to GitHub:**

Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**. Paste your public key and save.

![Image](/images/addsshkey.png)

**5. Test your connection:**

```sh title="Terminal"
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."
![Image](/images/lazygit-ssh.png)


**6. Check your remote URL:**

```sh title="Terminal"
git remote -v
```

If it shows `https://github.com/...` and you want to use SSH, switch it:

```sh title="Terminal"
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPO.git
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your fork (e.g., `yourusername/2026`).
</Step>

<Step>
### Fork and Clone the Repository

```sh title="Terminal"
# Fork and clone the ARC docs repo to your GitHub account, then open it
gh repo fork Autonomous-Robotics-Carleton/2026 --clone
cd 2026
cd 2025
pnpm dev # start the dev server
```

Open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Or your preferred editor):
          ```sh title="Shell"
          # Allow all hosts and trust the authors when you see a popup
          # And install all recommended extensions
          code .
          ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

After cloning, you'll find this structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="2026" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="2025" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="app">
        <Folder name="docs" />
        <File name="layout.tsx" />
        <File name="global.css" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="content">
        <Folder name="docs" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="lib">
        <File name="source.ts" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="public" />
      <File name="package.json" />
      <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

<div id="verify-setup" />

## Required Tools Summary

<TypeTable
  type={{
    pnpm: { description: 'Package manager', type: 'string', default: 'Latest' },
    node: { description: 'Node.js runtime', type: 'string', default: '22.x LTS' },
    gh: { description: 'GitHub CLI', type: 'string', default: 'Latest' },
    lazygit: { description: 'Git TUI (optional)', type: 'string', default: 'Latest' },
  }}
/>

## Verify Your Setup

Before diving in, run these quick checks to make sure everything is configured:

```sh title="Terminal"
# Git identity set?
git config --global --get user.name
git config --global --get user.email

# SSH key exists?
ls -la ~/.ssh

# SSH agent has your key?
ssh-add -l

# GitHub connection works?
ssh -T git@github.com

# lazygit installed?
lazygit --version
```

If any of these fail, revisit the relevant section above.

<div id="troubleshooting" />

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey)">
This means Git can't authenticate with GitHub over SSH. Common fixes:

1. **Check if your key is loaded:**
   ```sh
   ssh-add -l
   ```
   If it says "no identities", add your key:
   ```sh
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

2. **Verify GitHub has your public key:**
   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Compare with what's in GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys.

3. **Test the connection:**
   ```sh
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

4. **Check your remote uses SSH (not HTTPS):**
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   If it shows `https://`, switch to SSH:
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPO.git
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="src refspec main does not match any">
This usually means you're trying to push but there's no commit yet, or the branch name doesn't match.

1. **Check your current state:**
   ```sh
   git status
   git branch
   ```

2. **If there's no commit yet, create one:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
   ```

3. **Push to the correct branch:**
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **If your branch is called `master` but remote expects `main`:**
   ```sh
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Author identity unknown">
Git doesn't know who you are. Set your identity:
```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```
See [Set Your Git Identity](#git-identity) for details.
