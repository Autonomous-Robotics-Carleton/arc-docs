Welcome to the **documentation hub** for **ARC (Autonomous Robotics Carleton)**!  
This project is dedicated to documenting everything about building, configuring, and maintaining our **autonomous car** as we prepare for competitions.  

We’re keeping this project **fully open source**, so current and future members — and the wider robotics community — can learn, contribute, and grow with us.

## 📖 What’s Inside  

This repository contains:  
- ✅ **Setup guides** — step-by-step instructions for getting the ARC car up and running.  
- 🛠 **Configuration docs** — details on software, hardware, and environment settings.  
- 📚 **Knowledge base** — collected learnings and resources as the project evolves.  
- 🏎 **Race preparation logs** — documenting our progress on the road to competition.
