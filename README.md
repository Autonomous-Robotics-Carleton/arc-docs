Welcome to the **documentation hub** for **ARC (Autonomous Robotics Carleton)**!  
This project is dedicated to documenting everything about building, configuring, and maintaining our **autonomous car** as we prepare for competitions.  

We’re keeping this project **fully open source**, so current and future members — and the wider robotics community — can learn, contribute, and grow with us.  

---

## 📖 What’s Inside  

This repository contains:  
- ✅ **Setup guides** — step-by-step instructions for getting the ARC car up and running.  
- 🛠 **Configuration docs** — details on software, hardware, and environment settings.  
- 📚 **Knowledge base** — collected learnings and resources as the project evolves.  
- 🏎 **Race preparation logs** — documenting our progress on the road to competition.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arcarleton/arc-docs.git
   cd arc-docs
---

All documentation source code lives inside the **`2025/` directory**.

---

# 🔧 Local Development (for Contributors)

Contributors **do NOT need Docker**.
Docker is used only in production via CI/CD.

Everything you need is inside the **2025/** project.

---

## 📌 Requirements

Install:

* **Node.js 20**
* **pnpm** (via Corepack)
* **Git**

Enable pnpm if needed:

```bash
corepack enable
```

---

## 🛠 Install Dependencies

```bash
cd 2025
pnpm install
```

This uses `pnpm-lock.yaml` to ensure all contributors use identical dependency versions.

---

## ▶️ Run the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Site is now live at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🧪 Lint + Build

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

---
## 2️⃣ Make Your Changes

Docs live in:

```
2025/content/
```

UI + logic:

```
2025/app/
2025/lib/
```

---

## 3️⃣ Test Locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
---

# 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline

This repository uses **GitHub Actions + GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.

### 🔹 For every Pull Request:

* Installs dependencies
* Lints the docs
* Builds the site
* Tests Docker build

### 🔹 For every merge to `main`:

* Builds the production Docker image
* Pushes it to GHCR:

  * `ghcr.io/autonomous-robotics-carleton/arc-docs:latest`
  * `ghcr.io/autonomous-robotics-carleton/arc-docs:<commit-sha>`
* ARC infrastructure auto-deploys the new version to **arcarleton.ca** via Watchtower

Contributors never touch Docker.
